\title{Running CircHunter circRNA quantification module}
\usage{
circrnaQuantification(group = c("sudo", "docker"), scratch.folder,
  rnaseq.data, backsplicing_junctions.data, hc.params)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: \code{"sudo"} or \code{"docker"}, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{rnaseq.data, }{string indicating the path to the fastq file of the RNA-Seq dataset to analyse}

\item{backsplicing_junctions.data, }{string indicating the path to the fasta file of the circRNA back-splicing sequences to search in the RNA-Seq dataset}

\item{hc.params, }{vector of six parameters to set the analysis. The element of the vector indicate in order: the k-mer size, the thread number, the dimension of the hash table, the dimension of the collision list, the number of k-mers that must be matched to the sequence to consider the sequence itself as represented in the RNA-Seq data, and the number of perfect matches required in the k-mer to consider it matched to a sequence.}
}
\value{
A count table reporting the number of RNA-Seq reads supporting specific circRNA back-splice junctions
}
\description{
This function executes the docker container circhunter by running the circRNA quantification module of CircHunter to quantify the level of expression of a set of circRNA BS sequences in a given RNA-Seq experiment. For CircHunter algorithm detail please refer to: https://github.com/carlo-deintinis/circhunter/tree/master/CircHunter.
