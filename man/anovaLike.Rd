\title{A function allowing the identification of differentially expressed genes if multiple groups are provided.}
\usage{
anovaLike(group = c("sudo", "docker"), file, logFC.threshold = 1,
  FDR.threshold, logCPM.threshold = 4, plot = c(TRUE, FALSE))
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{file, }{a character string indicating the path of the file, with counts.table name and extension included}

\item{logFC.threshold, }{minimal logFC present in at least one of the comparisons with respect to reference covariate}

\item{FDR.threshold, }{minimal FDR present in at least one of the comparisons with respect to reference covariate}

\item{logCPM.threshold, }{minimal average abundance}

\item{plot, }{TRUE if differentially expressed genes are represented in a plot.}
}
\description{
This function executes in a docker edgeR for the identification of differentially expressed genes in bulk RNAseq
}
