\title{Function to merge different circRNA lists from CIRI 2}
\usage{
ciri2MergePredictions(group = c("sudo", "docker"), scratch.folder,
  data.folder, samples.list, covariates.list, covariate.order,
  min_reads = 2, min_reps = 0, min_avg = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: \code{"sudo"} or \code{"docker"}, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{data.folder, }{a character string indicating the data folder where the CIRI 2 output files are located}

\item{samples.list, }{a character vector indicating the identifiers of the samples}

\item{covariates.list, }{a character vector indicating the classes of the samples}

\item{covariate.order, }{a character vector indicating ...}

\item{min_reads, }{the minimum number of back-splicing reads supporting a circRNA and detected in at least min_reps number of biological replicates of the same experimental condition (default = 2)}

\item{min_reps, }{the minimum number of replicates associated with at least min_reads supporting a circRNA (default = 0)}

\item{min_avg, }{the average number of back-splicing reads across biological replicates of the same experimental condition that shall support a circRNA (default = 10)}
}
\value{
Two tab-delimited tables reporting the BS supporting reads and the coordinates of the filtered circRNAs are reported
}
\description{
This function executes the docker container ciri2merge by running the merge of different lists of circRNAs predicted by CIRI2  following a sample data files provided by the user. The function executes also a filter based on the number of back-splicing reads computed in each experiment and across replicates of the same biological condition.
