\title{Running Star two steps for variant calls}
\usage{
star2steps(group = c("sudo", "docker"), fastq.folder = getwd(),
  scratch.folder = "/data/scratch", genome.folder, groupid,
  threads = 1, opossum.preprocessing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: \code{"sudo"} or \code{"docker"}, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{fastq.folder, }{a character string indicating where gzip fastq files are located}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{genome.folder, }{a character string indicating the folder where the indexed reference genome for STAR is located.}

\item{groupid, }{a character string to be inserted in the bam as identifier for the sample}

\item{threads, }{a number indicating the number of cores to be used from the application}

\item{opossum.preprocessing, }{a boolean TRUE or FALSE to use opossum for RNAseq data preprocessing https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/2-6/v1}
}
\value{
three files: dedup_reads.bam, which is sorted and duplicates marked bam file, dedup_reads.bai, which is the index of the dedup_reads.bam, and dedup_reads.stats, which provides mapping statistics
}
\description{
This function executes the two steps STAR as sugested by best practice GATK for calling variants on RNAseq data only PE data are accepted
}
