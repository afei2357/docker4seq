\title{Platypus filter analysis NOT READY TO GO ON STABLE to be used in case the full platypus workflow fail.}
\usage{
platypusFilter(group = c("sudo", "docker"), data.folder = getwd(),
  scratch.folder, GQ, minSampGQ, NR, minSampNR, NV, minSampNV,
  normal_samples, GT_normal, minSampGT_normal, tumoral_samples, GT_tumoral,
  minSampGT_tumoral, stringent_filter, annotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{data.folder, }{a character string indicating the folder where bams and vcf files are located and where output will be written}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the scratch folder}

\item{GQ, }{min GQ value to consider (extreme included)}

\item{minSampGQ, }{min number of samples with GQ value (extreme included), usually we start with 85\% of the samples}

\item{NR, }{min NR value to consider (extreme included), the number of reads covering the SNV region}

\item{minSampNR, }{min number of samples with NR value (extreme included), usually we start with 85\% of the samples}

\item{NV, }{min NV value to consider (extreme included), the n of reads with the SNV}

\item{minSampNV, }{min number of samples with NV value (extreme included)}

\item{normal_samples, }{string with names (group names of bam files) of normal samples separated by hash, write NULL if you do not want to use GT filter in normal samples}

\item{GT_normal, }{GT value in normal samples to consider, type "NO" if you do not want to use this filter, else e.g. you might use 0/0}

\item{minSampGT_normal, }{min number of normal samples with GT value}

\item{tumoral_samples, }{string with names (group names of bam files) of tumoral samples separated by &, write NULL if you do not want to use GT filter in normal samples}

\item{GT_tumoral, }{GT value in tumoral samples to consider, type "NO" if you do not want to use this filter. Type e.g. 0/0 if you do not want to consider this genotype.}

\item{minSampGT_tumoral, }{min number of tumoral samples in which the GT value is NOT present}

\item{stringent_filter, }{To enable the filter (it keeps only the variants with "PASS" value or the variants that have only the "alleleBias" value) use 1 or 0 to disable it}

\item{annotation, }{hg19 and mm10 are actually available for the annotation of the detected SNVs}
