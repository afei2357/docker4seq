\title{Running indel relignment and quality recalibration on bam generated by bwa function NOT READY TO GO ON STABLE}
\usage{
snvPreprocessing(group = c("sudo", "docker"), bam.folder = getwd(),
  scratch.folder = "/data/scratch", genome.folder, threads = 8,
  gatk.file)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: \code{"sudo"} or \code{"docker"}, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{bam.folder, }{a character string indicating where bam file generated by bwa is located}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{genome.folder, }{a character string indicating the folder where the index reference genome for bwa is located}

\item{threads, }{a number indicating the number of cores to be used by the application}

\item{gatk.file, }{a character string for GenomeAnalysisTK-X.Y.tar.bz2, this file should be located in the bam.folder}
}
\value{
bam and bai after indel relignment and quality recalibration.
}
\description{
This function executes the docker container snvPreprocessing. IMPORTANT: the working folder require the presence of GenomeAnalysisTK.tar.bz2 files
