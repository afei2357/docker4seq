\title{Running starchip to detect circular RNAs on paired-end sequences}
\usage{
starchipCircle(group = c("sudo", "docker"), genome.folder,
  scratch.folder, samples.folder, reads.cutoff, min.subject.limit, threads,
  do.splice = c("True", "False"), cpm.cutoff = 0,
  subjectCPM.cutoff = 0, annotation = c("true", "false"))
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{genome.folder, }{a character string indicating the folder where the indexed reference genome for STAR is located.}

\item{scratch.folder, }{a character string indicating the scratch folder where docker container will be mounted}

\item{samples.folder, }{the folder where are located all the folders of the samples processed with starChimeric}

\item{reads.cutoff, }{Integer. Minimum number of reads crossing the circular RNA backsplice required.}

\item{min.subject.limit, }{Integer. Minimum number of individuals with readsCutoff reads required to carry forward a cRNA for analysis}

\item{threads, }{Integer. Number of threads to use}

\item{do.splice, }{true false. The splices within the cRNA be detected and reported. Linear splices are searched within each cRNA in each individual. Any linear splice with >= 60\% of the read count of the cRNA is considered a splice within the cRNA. Two files are then created, .consensus with most common splice pattern, and .allvariants with all reported splice patterns.}

\item{cpm.cutoff, }{Float. Reads counts are loaded into R and log2(CountsPerMillion) is calculated using the limma package. With cpmCutoff > 0, cRNA with log2(CPM) below this value will be filtered from this analysis}

\item{subjectCPM.cutoff, }{Integer. See above. This value is the lower limit for number of individuals required to have the cRNA expressed at a value higher than cpmCutoff.}

\item{annotation, }{rue/false. cRNA are provided with gene annotations}

\description{
This function execute starchip on a set of folders containing the output of starChimeric. It requires a specific bed generated with starChipIndex in teh genome folder used by starChimeric
