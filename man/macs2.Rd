\title{A function to handle a MACS2 containier}
\usage{
macs2(group = c("sudo", "docker"), control.bam, chipseq.bam,
  experiment.name, histone.marks = FALSE, broad.cutoff = 0.1,
  qvalue = 0.05, organism = c("hs", "mm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{control.bam, }{aa character string indicating the path to the control bam file. IMPORTANT control.bam and chipseq.bam are in the same folder}

\item{chipseq.bam, }{a character string indicating the path to the chipseq bam file. IMPORTANT control.bam and chipseq.bam are in the same folder}

\item{experiment.name, }{a character string indicating the prefix for MCS2 output}

\item{histone.marks, }{boolean if TRUE activate the broad option to call histone marks}

\item{broad.cutoff, }{if histone.mark is TRUE broad.cutoff can be set, default 0.1}

\item{qvalue, }{The qvalue (minimum FDR) cutoff to call significant regions. Default is 0.05. For broad marks, you can try 0.05 as cutoff.}

\item{organism, }{required to select the correct genome size avaialble options hs, mm}
}
\value{
NAME_peaks.xls, which is a tabular file which contains information about called peaks. You can open it in excel and sort/filter using excel functions. Information include: chromosome name, start position of peak, end position of peak, length of peak region, absolute peak summit position, pileup height at peak summit, -log10(pvalue) for the peak summit (e.g. pvalue =1e-10, then this value should be 10), fold enrichment for this peak summit against random Poisson distribution with local lambda, -log10(qvalue) at peak summit. NAME_peaks.narrowPeak is BED6+4 format file which contains the peak locations together with peak summit, pvalue and qvalue. You can load it to UCSC genome browser. Definition of some specific columns are: 5th: integer score for display calculated as int(-10*log10qvalue). Please note that currently this value might be out of the [0-1000] range defined in UCSC Encode narrowPeak format, 7th: fold-change, 8th: -log10pvalue, 9th: -log10qvalue, 10th: relative summit position to peak start. NAME_peaks.broadPeak is in BED6+3 format which is similar to narrowPeak file.

\description{
This function executes a MACS2 docker that produces as output peaks call
